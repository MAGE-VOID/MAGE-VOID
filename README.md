### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I’m [**Manuel**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mage-void), a Software Engineer & AI Tinkerer based in Lima, Peru. I love building systems that think for themselves and optimizing engines—both in code and on the road.

**These days I’m focused on:**
- AI Agents & Large Language Models (LLMs)
- High-performance Cloud Architecture (AWS)
- Algorithmic Trading strategies & Financial Tech

---

**Some stuff I built:**
- [**JobThis**](https://github.com/MAGE-VOID/JobThis) - An intelligent job scraping tool that hunts for hidden opportunities so I don't have to.
- [**Algo Trading Bridge**](https://github.com/MAGE-VOID/Server_Python_MQL5) - A stable connection between Python ML models and live financial markets (MetaTrader 5).
- **Quant Simulator** - A high-speed backtesting engine that simulates years of trading data in seconds.
- **Binder AI** - A document processing platform that turns messy PDFs into structured, clean data using AI.

**Fun Facts:**

* 🏍️ **Gearhead:** I’m currently customizing a **QJ Motor SRV 600 V** motorcycle. I enjoy 3D modeling custom parts almost as much as riding.
* 🏋️‍♂️ **Discipline:** I bring the same consistency to the gym (lifting heavy) as I do to maintaining clean code.
* 🧠 **Philosophy:** I define myself as a "Tinkerer"—I learn by taking things apart and putting them back together better than before.
* 🇵🇪 **Fuel:** Powered by strong coffee and Lomo Saltado.
