### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

### I'm [Manuel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mage-void).

I specialize in building systems that require high precision: from algorithmic trading engines to computer vision solutions. My focus is on bridging the gap between raw data and actionable intelligence, optimizing performance whether it's in the cloud or on the edge.

### ⚡ What drives me

I operate at the intersection of **Financial Tech** and **Artificial Intelligence**. I don't just write software; I architect ecosystems that can analyze, adapt, and execute autonomously.

* **Autonomous Systems:** Developing agents and LLMs that reduce human operational load.
* **Algorithmic Trading:** Creating low-latency bridges for real-time financial markets.
* **Engineering Mindset:** Applying strict architectural patterns to chaotic data streams.

### 🔌 Offline Mode: The "Mechanic" Mindset

My obsession with **performance** doesn't end at the terminal. I approach the physical world with the same engineering rigor I apply to software
